# Pokemon-MMO

This is created as an assignment for Sunway University's Distributed System where we were required to create a multiplayer game in Scala 
that using the framework AKKA. 

This project uses the concept of the existing Pokemon game where the player may roam around in the world and encounter wild pokemons.
When encoutering wild pokemons, they are prompted to the battle screen where they may battle them with their own pokemons, each having
a minimum of 1 and up to 4 skills, the usage of potions allows the player to heal their injured pokemons and pokeballs allows them to
capture the wild pokemons. Trainer system has also been implemented allowing players to battle them. Among winning battles, cash
and experience are awarded, players may use cash to purchase a variety of potions and pokeballs which will aid them. Experience points on
the other hand is only awarded to pokemons which participated in the won battle, they may level up and be able to learn new skills.

In addition, the game has been made into an MMO where other players from anywhere in the world can connect to the same server 
and see other players. They may speak to each other by typing in the chat box or battle each other.
